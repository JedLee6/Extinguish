Please be aware that granting Shizuku permissions means giving the app the ability to override the Android permissions management system to perform high-level privileges. You are responsible for the security of your device.
At the same time, the ability to apply under Shizuku permissions is limited. As so, Extinguish may not work properly on some devices.
